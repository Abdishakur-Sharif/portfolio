              I am a passionate junior full-stack developer who began my coding
              journey in 2024 through an intensive 6-month bootcamp. This
              experience ignited my love for programming and problem-solving,
              pushing me to continually improve my skills and explore the world
              of web development. I am eager to contribute as both an employee
              in a collaborative team and as a freelancer delivering quality
              projects tailored to client needs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
              Beyond coding, I have a growing passion for design and strive to
              create visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly
              applications. The tech world fascinates me because of its endless
              possibilities, whether it's building dynamic front-end interfaces
              or creating scalable back-end systems.

            Error 404: Not Found. That's rightâ€”I currently have no professional
            experience in the industry. However, what I lack in experience, I
            make up for with determination, self-discipline, and an insatiable
            desire to learn and grow.

            Through personal projects, collaborations, and continuous learning,
            I have cultivated a strong foundation in full-stack development.
            While I may not yet have industry experience, I am confident in my
            ability to contribute meaningfully to a team and tackle challenges
            head-on.
